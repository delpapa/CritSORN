# SORN 

This code contains the necessary files to simulate the SORN model and perform the avalanche analysis as described in Del Papa et al. 2017. It is based on the previous implementation by [Hartmann et al.](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004640), which can be found [here](https://github.com/chrhartm/SORN). 

At the moment, it is not pretty or well organized. Updates will be made in the next days in order to improve clarity and organization. As of now, one should pay special attention and change the data folder path according to the current experiment path.

## Experiments

To run simple SORN experiments, proceed in the same way as the original SORN code: navigate to the *common* folder and run `python test_single.py your_parameter_file`. These simulations will store the relevant data in a `backup` folder.

To run the avalanche analysis, you first need to 

## Files and data for Del Papa et al. 2017

The experiments and parameter files from the paper can be found in the `delpapa` folder. The subfolder `Avalanche_Codes` contains the exact code to reproduce the paper figures.
